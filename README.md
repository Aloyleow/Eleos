# Development of Lets * Help Â (V1.0.0)


## Project summary

### MVP
- The back-end application is built with Express.
- The front-end application is built with React.
- PostgreSQL is used as the database management system.
- The back-end and front-end applications implement JWT token-based authentication to sign up, sign in, and sign out users.
- Authorization is implemented across the front-end and back-end. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
- The project has at least one data entity in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
- The project has full CRUD functionality on both the back-end and front-end.
- The front-end application does not hold any secret keys. Public APIs that require secret keys must be accessed from the back-end application.

### Description of App

LETSHELP is a volunteer event platform. Social services group, charity organizations or wildlife conservation groups can join this application and apply as a HOST. They will be able to create events if one of their projects require volunteer s. People who signs up as users are then able to join these events. Everyone can view all the events but only host/users will be able to view it in detail

### Summarised review after completion

The development of this app(V1.0.0) was a intense yet fun journey, this is because of a huge ambition that i wanted to fulfil 1 week back. By first creating the backend data requirements, I was able to start visualizing the front-end wire frame and how the workflow should go. I then started out on the basic functionality of the app, slowly i realised there are actually more i could improve and implement. I ended up implementing more features than i planned over the duration of the project. Learning and implementing new stuff as I was building the app was the most exciting part of the journey and i am now very accustomed in handling both frontend and backend simultaneously.

### Future state of Covid-19 Data Analysis and Tracker
